# Stack and Queue 
## Stack
 is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
- push , pop , peek , isEmpty 
FILO OR LIFO 

## Queue
FIFO :First In First Out

LILO : Last In Last Out

- Enqueue , Dequeue , Peek , isEmpty 

## Challenge
implement the stack and queue

## test:
![image](./stack%24%26queue%20test.png)


 ## Approach & Efficiency
time and space for all operations : O(1)


## Stack methods:
push: takes an argument and adds a new node with the argument's value to the top of the stack.
pop: removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value.
peek : returns the value of the node located on top of the stack

isEmpty:returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

## Queue methods:
enqueue: takes an argument and adds a new node with the argument's value to the back of the queue 
dequeue :removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value.
peek :returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue
isEmpty:returns a boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty.
